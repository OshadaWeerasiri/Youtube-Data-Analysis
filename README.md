# Youtube-Data-Engineering-project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline built on AWS to process and analyze YouTube trending video statistics from multiple countries. It showcases how to efficiently ingest, transform, store, and visualize large volumes of structured and semi-structured data using AWS-native services.

### ðŸš€Project Objectives

âœ… Ingest YouTube trending data (CSV & JSON) from multiple regions

âœ… Transform and clean data using AWS Glue

âœ… Store raw and processed data in Amazon S3 Data Lake

âœ… Query data using Amazon Athena

âœ… Build interactive visualizations using Amazon QuickSight

âœ… Ensure scalability, modularity, and cloud efficiency
